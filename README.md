# Gesture-Hand

this project involves using a camera to detect hand gestures and translate them into movements on a robotic hand. 
Project is hosted on: Linux, Computer Vision Library: OpenCV hardware used: Arduino, Camera, PC

project steps: 
- python script using opencv capture the state of the hand 
- divide every finger to 3 parts
- send data about every finger to arduino through serial communcaiton
- arduino try to emulate the same captured motion
